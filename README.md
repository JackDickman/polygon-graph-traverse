# polygon-graph-traverse
This is an assignment I completed for the CSC545 class at the University of Miami in 2017.

The user will be prompted to enter the coordinates of the vertices of any number of polygons on a graph. They will also enter the coordinates of the goal state. The start state will be assumed to be 0,0.

The program will find a path from the start to the goal using straight lines connecting vertices of the polygons. It will do this utilizing the A* algorithm and a greedy algorithm, comparing the path cost and run times.
